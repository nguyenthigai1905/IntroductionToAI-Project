# IntroductionToAI-Project
## This is our group's data mining project in the course of Introduction to artificial intelligence.

Many businesses/agencies are interested in people's comments/reviews about a product or a certain issue. This feedback helps businesses/agencies have feedback to create positive results and limit negative ones. Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in databases, uses a variety of statistical tools and artificial intelligence (such as neural networks or machine learning) with database management and databases to analyze big data. Data collection techniques have been widely applied to problems in industry, science, and engineering, and it is believed that collecting data will profoundly impact our lives. However, the field of data collection is still quite inaccessible to everyone because of its inherent complexity.

Currently, quite a few tools can perform data collection, but most are still quite difficult to access for many people because these tools require users to have a certain knowledge of computers to be able to do this. Performing operations on the tool.

Data mining project with the goal of helping people have an overview of data mining and how to use some of the tools available today to collect some information about comments from users, and some popular service websites.

## About the project

In this project we will go through 3 parts:
- Learn about the concepts, features, and applications of data mining.
- Learn about the structure of a website, security issues, and data collection tools: Octoparse, Parsehub. In this section, we built a Datacrawler tool to collect data from the API of Tiki and Shopee.
- Processing and analyzing data after extraction.

## How to use datacrawler: 
- Download folder Datacrawler.
- Execute the DataCrawler.exe file.
